Atari Breakout Video Game from Scratch Implementation with C++ and OpenGL.
• Used modern C++ (C++11 and C++14) to wrap the C language-based OpenGL graphical API by following the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) pattern.

• Utilized Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to depict the game architecture prototype.

• Exploited OpenGL rendering APIs and shading language (GLSL) to go through the complete CG pipeline (Vertex Shader, Geometry Shader, Rasterization, Fragment Shader, Testing and Blending)

This project is the final project for book 《Learn OpenGL - Graphics Computing》
